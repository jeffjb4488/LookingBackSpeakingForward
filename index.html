                        <p class="mb-3">In 2008, Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to commence an avenue of truth, healing, and recovery. After hosting public events, speaking to survivors, and collecting stories, the TRC created an exhibit housing some of the items donated as a gesture of reconciliation. These displays grant the opportunity to gauge their audience’s moods as they gaze upon the objects, but such interactions can appear monovocal and isolating, can limit a display’s longevity and impact beyond that present moment, and may not easily invite audiences to do more than gaze upon an object in a cathartic or reflexive state. Therefore, this project’s intent is to showcase how these gestures of reconciliation are more than objects or representations of the past; they do more than allow us to look back at our history; instead they look back at us in collaborative and combative ways. You can listen to these stories by visiting the Canadian Museum of Human Rights or contacting us to add your contribution.</p>
