                                    Storytellers may share oral or written narratives freely or based on prompts provided by the museum specific to individual objects in the exhibits and the Childhood Denied narrative. For example, a prompt referring to the hand-painted acoustic guitar could ask storytellers to share how music relates to their own, their family’s, or their community’s / institution’s experiences with Residential Schools and/or processes of healing, or lack thereof.

The audience viewing the objects and reading what experiences it symbolizes will be able to hear additional stories related to the object and to the experiences. By including many voices the audience will see the broad impacts of residential schools and the diverse views on reconciliation. The exhibit will encourage the audience to lend their voices to larger conversations on history, settler-colonialism, and Truth and Reconciliation work.
